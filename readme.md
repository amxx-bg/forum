# AMXX-BG Forum Readme
## About

AMXXBG is an open source forum application released under the GNU General Public
Licence. It is free to download and use and will remain so. AMXXBG is
based on Slim Framework and designed to be simple and very performant,
with modern features: MVC architecture, PDO, OOP and a plugin system. Maybe more?
You are more than welcome to join the development :-)

## Changelog

This is __amxxbg v0.1.3 Dev__. It is intended for testing purposes only and not
for use in a production environment. Please report all the bugs you may encounter to
the forums or in the GitHub bug tracker.

## Requirements

* A webserver
* PHP 5.5.0 or later
* A database such as MySQL 4.1.2 or later, PostgreSQL 7.0 or later, SQLite 2 or later

## Recommendations

* Make use of a PHP accelerator such as OPCache
* Make sure PHP has the zlib module installed to allow AMXXBG to gzip output
* If you download directly from the repository, make sure to run a composer install
to setup the dependencies (Slim Framework and some more)
